        "description": "Developed an automated road damage detection system using transfer learning on a locally annotated dataset, tailored for Bangladeshi conditions.  Integrated global Road Damage Dataset (RDD) standards and user feedback to improve detection accuracy and relevance. Incorporated Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles, ensuring user trust, transparency, and practical deployment potential."
